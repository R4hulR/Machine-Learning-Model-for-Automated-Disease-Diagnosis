# Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project aims to develop a robust machine learning model capable of predicting diseases based on the symptoms exhibited by a patient. The model leverages an ensemble approach, combining the predictions of multiple algorithms to enhance accuracy and robustness.

## Overview

The disease prediction system is built using Python and various machine learning libraries. The project follows a structured approach, including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment. The main steps involved are:

1. Data Preprocessing: The dataset is cleaned, and missing values are handled. Categorical variables are encoded for model compatibility.
2. Model Training: Three different machine learning algorithms (Support Vector Machines, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest) are trained on the preprocessed data.
3. Model Evaluation: The performance of each model is evaluated using k-fold cross-validation and appropriate metrics like accuracy and confusion matrices.
4. Ensemble Learning: The predictions from the three models are combined using an ensemble technique, taking the mode of their individual predictions to improve overall accuracy.
5. Deployment: A user-friendly function is implemented to accept symptom inputs and generate disease predictions in a JSON format.

## Dataset

The project utilizes a dataset from Kaggle, which consists of two CSV files: one for training and one for testing. The dataset contains 133 columns, where 132 columns represent symptoms, and the last column is the prognosis (disease label). https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kaushil268/disease-prediction-using-machine-learning

## Libraries Used

The following Python libraries are utilized in this project:

- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://https://github.com/R4hulR/Machine-Learning-Model-for-Automated-Disease-Diagnosis.git
```

2. Install the required libraries:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Place the dataset files (`train.csv` and `test.csv`) in the `dataset` directory.

4. Run the Jupyter Notebook or the Python script to preprocess the data, train the models, and generate predictions.

5. Use the `predictDisease` function to input a comma-separated list of symptoms and obtain the predicted disease.

```python
predictions = predictDisease("fever, cough, fatigue")
print(predictions)
```
